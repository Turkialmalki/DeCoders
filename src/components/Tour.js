        <p> In almost no time, the city of Al-Ula in northwest Saudi Arabia went
              from being relatively unknown to a very early symbol of success for
              the Kingdomâ€™s ambitious Vision 2030 reform plan. Not many places in
              the world can say they are sitting on 3,000 years of history, which is
              the case with Al-Ula, which is home to the UNESCO World Heritage
              Site of Madain Saleh.

              <li>Winter at Tantora</li>
              <p>It is a music festival, which was sold out every night between
                 December and February as visitors flocked to see legends such
                 as Andrea Bocelli, Yanni, Mohammed Abdo and Majida
                 El-Roumi perform. The people of Al-Ula hosted 37,000 visitors
                 from 72 countries around the world during the first successful
                 annual Winter at Tantora festival.
               </p>
               <li>Hot Air Balloon</li>
               <p>This festival presented a blueprint for adventure tourism in
                  Saudi Arabia. Next, the Dakar Rally will take place there in 2020.
